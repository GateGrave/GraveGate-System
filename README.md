\# GateGrave Bot System



A Discord-based RPG engine for a roleplay server inspired by D\&D 5e with gestalt leveling.



\## Architecture Rules

\- Event-driven and modular

\- All gameplay actions are JSON events

\- Systems never call each other directly

\- All communication goes through the event queue

\- Database is the source of truth

\- State is divided into World State, Session State, and Combat State

\- Gateway contains no gameplay logic

\- Combat instances must always be isolated



\## Core Services

\- Discord Gateway

\- Event Queue

\- Event Router

\- World System

\- Session System

\- Combat System
